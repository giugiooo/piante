# WATERING GREENHOUSE - Project for the course "Embedded Software for the Internet of Things" (group 19)

This project consists in a greenhouse connected to a display which provides informations about the environment inside the planthouse (temperature and brightness) and about the plants living inside of it (soil humidity). In addition to the monitoring process, the greenhouse is able to water the plants when needed and to notify the plant owner when compares any issue (eg. water tank needs to be refilled). 
Our aim? Keeping a plant alive! 

## FEATURES:
The features implemented and tested in the project are the following:

- Checks the temperature inside the greenhouse;
- Checks the brightness of the environment;
- checks if the soil is humid enough; 
- erogates water from a water tank when the plant needs it;
- notifies the plant owner when the water tank is empty;
- displays informations about temperature/brightness of the environment and level of water in the tank
- if the tank is almost empty a red led lights up in the greenhouse  

## REQUIREMENTS:
